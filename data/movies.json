But how geologically accurate is it truly? \n\nWhilst the premise of the film isn’t far-fetched it is unlikely that all the other volcanologists in the film don’t notice the dangers that he does. But regardless there are a few instances where the facts become fiction. One of these takes place during the eruption of the volcano. There are several scenes in which we see large lava flows travelling at very high speeds. This is incorrect because the volcano in the film is a composite cone volcano and the lava released from this type is usually far more viscous and so travels far slower due to a much higher silica content. Obviously this is done to create a level of tension within the film however it is completely inaccurate. \n\nSecondly, before the eruption, there is a series of earthquakes that cause catastrophic damage to the surrounding city. This is also unrealistic as earthquakes that correlate with volcanic activity rarely exceed a 6 in magnitude. In today's infrastructure, there is little to no chance that an earthquake of that strength would cause that much damage. That level of earthquake would likely cause minor structural damage at best. \n\nThe most significant act of geological sacrilege in this film comes from one particular scene. When the main character tries to drive over a lava flow. As I mentioned previously, the lava of the volcano would’ve been incredibly viscous. This means that the tyres would likely get no spin as they get stuck into the lava; effectively trapping them in the middle of the lava flow. Lava ranges from temperatures of 700 to 1200 degrees Celsius. This means it would be mere seconds before the rubber on the tires is melted and they get trapped for an inevitable death. It would take minutes before the truck was entirely melted. It's bad enough that they were able to drive over it in the film but it only gets worse from there. Their truck with no tyres then proceeds to escape a pyroclastic flow keeping them alive. Pyroclastic flows travel at an average speed of 100 km/h and can reach speeds of 700 km/h. This makes it highly unlikely a truck with no wheels would escape this interaction.\n\nWhile it's a great film to watch with the family, if you are a keen geologist that needs films to be accurate. This may not be fair you.",

                "analysis": "The movie starts with the protagonist having a dream involving the three most famous geological icons. Trilobites, tyrannosaurus rex and a very exaggerated earthquake and completely unrealistic several meter wide fissure with lava at the bottom. Our geology professor protagonist (Brendan) and nephew, Josh Hutcherson (Sean), go to Iceland after finding that Sean's dad's seismometers are all reading picking up the exact same data as when his dad (Max) went missing a decade ago. This is all fine so far, the main issue which makes the geology incorrect in this film happens when they (surprisingly) theorize the Earth is as it is in Jules Verne’s A Journey to the Center of the Earth. Upon arriving in Iceland he goes searching for information about Max's disappearance with a local mountaineer whose dad also went missing. Eventually after reaching the seismometer he immediately breaks it by violently removing it from its foundation which wasn’t the greatest idea. Especially as the fact that he ended up trapped in a cave after.\n\nIn this cave they found some interesting and questionable geology. Firstly, explosive magnesium veins line the wall, magnesium is typically mined as magnesium chloride from evaporites and then separated using electrolysis. These veins are hence most likely magnesium chloride deposited from running water, however this would not be explosive because you would not find pure magnesium metal because it is too reactive. Stalactites on the roof of the cave also provide evidence of water flow in these beds.\n\nBrendan finds some metamorphic rock, specifically schist, he announces this to his posse for no reason other than it interests him despite hanging from a rope rappelling into a deep hole. He even specifies the type of schist: green schist, garnet-containing schist, mica and garnet-containing schist. This accuracy earns the movie bonus geological accuracy points.\n\nThis hole is a hole which can only be an old mine shaft due to its shape which is likely considering a mine sits at the bottom. This mine must be the most profitable ever judging by the size of diamonds they collect and sell when they eventually resurface. Despite diamonds, emeralds and rubies lying everywhere, our protagonist excitedly announces that he has found some feldspar. Extra geology points for spotting a very common mineral before impossible minerals which are probably misidentified. For example, diamond could be quartz and emerald could be pure olivine.\n\nThey also fall through a correctly colored and textured muscovite mica floor (extra accuracy points) which perfectly shows the singular cleavage plane. Any points they gain through this are immediately lost by the following ‘hundreds of miles’ of falling to the center of the earth. They then arrive in a cavern which would collapse if not being held up and cooled by magic (see explanation in the Godzilla vs Kong section). In this world, evolution was paused at the K-Pg boundary, this is proved by the existence of dinosaurs here such as the Tyrannosaurus rex which chases Sean and the ‘cyanis rosopteryx’ (made-up dinosaur birds). The T. rex which chases them shouldn't do so, as T. rex is primarily a scavenger because it has short arms and long legs designed for endurance, not chases of hunters.\n\nThere is light down here equivalent to sunlight somehow. Whatever magical force cools the cave must be rubbish because the surrounding magma heats the cave up occasionally though frustratingly only 72 hours after our gang arrives there.\n\nFinally, Sean crosses a magical magnetic rock bridge and they ride a geyser up to the surface, without being melted, and straight out of the top of Mt. Vesuvius.",

That navigates the experiences of the main character as he is sentenced to life in prison after being wrongly accused of murder. Who then is forced into doing illegal things for a corrupt Warden using his previous occupation as a banker. An incredible film, but what relevance to geology does it have?\n\nWhile the film doesn’t go into significant detail about many geological topics, the main character is avidly interested in Geology. He is seen in one of his first interactions in prison picking up pieces of Mica and Feldspar. As he develops relationships in prison life, he manages to get his hands on a rock hammer through one of the inmates and uses his time to make many sculptures out of different minerals. He then uses this rock hammer to make his great escape after digging for many many years.\n\nOne of the main plot points comes about when the main character (Andy Dufresne) is talking to his closest friend (Red) in prison. He talks about a glassy black volcanic rock beneath a tree that has something hidden underneath. Geologist among you probably recognised immediately that it was going to be a large piece of obsidian, which ends up being true, and giving the film a heartwarming ending which ties together the values of the film such as hope and friendship.\n\nWhile this film doesn’t have much geological content, there are no inaccuracies within the science which makes it far more enjoyable to watch for those with a geological brain.",
